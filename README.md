# Masters simulations

Collection of jupyter notebooks for generating my MSc thesis data.

See my affiliated projects: [pynamics](https://github.com/jqhoogland/pynamics), [pytransfer](https://github.com/jqhoogland/pytransfer), [randnn](https://github.com/jqhoogland/randnn).

This repo contains all the simulation and analysis that combine the above projects. 

`/practice/`: For miscellaneous systems (viz., double well, lorenz).
`/reimplementation/`: For reimplementing the results of articles I've read.
`/output/`: The real deal new stuff.
